The goal is to create a large array A of n numbers at one node (let us call it the source node), distribute blocks of the
array across the processors, and find the global sum of the numbers in A.
The task is to solve this FIND SUM problem using at least these two different logical topologies:
1. a ring of k processors
2. a hypercube of k = 2d processors
